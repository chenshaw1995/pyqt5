complete simple spider so with inputed url and K, you could crawl webpages as you want. Just need to know, do not use too big K, because it is a simple spider with single thread. and memory is limited.

# TODO 
- need a input window for url and an integer K, 
-  then call call function in crawlerCall.py,      
  - create a label so user could choose two url by inputing two integer btwn 1 to k, then show these two pages on screen,  
  - show records btwn two urls by inputing two integer btwn 1 and k,
  > - result would be 1 is bigger than 2, or smaller, or no records,

  -  eliminate inconsistent comparisons, 

  - show topologically sort pages, 

  - show last topological sort result,

- create a data set for NN regression algo,

- modify nn algorithm for regression
